A week ago, I posted on r/askSingapore asking people's opinion on Singapore's shopping mall apps. Here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1gkvvlu/shopping_mall_app_yay_or_nay/).

Then I decided to try build on out myself on the web to see if the experience is any difference.

Over the week, I managed to get most of the basic features out

- Scan QR
- Upload files
- Data loading and filtering

Some learnings

- The screen will flash when moving to other pages
- Animation would be the key factor to make it more "app-like"
